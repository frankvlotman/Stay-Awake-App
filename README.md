# Stay-Awake-App

- Keeps your Windows PC awake by preventing the screen from going into sleep mode.

- Runs quietly in the system tray (bottom-right of the taskbar).

- Starts active immediately when double-clicked.

- Shows a short 2-second popup (“StayOn Activated”) on launch.

- Uses the Windows API (no fake mouse movements, no interference with your work).

- Reasserts every 30 seconds to make sure Windows stays awake.

- Tray menu has only “Quit”, to cleanly exit and restore normal sleep settings.
